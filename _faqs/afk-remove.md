I have to go for a while will I get kicked if I don’t chat?

• If you are not in the waitlist you don't have to worry about being removed from our community. If you are in the waitlist we would prefer if you were active and interacted with the community.
 
• We don’t consider wooting, mehing and grabbing songs as non-AFK activity. We remove AFK users from the waitlist to give active ones a chance to dj. It's not fair on others if the waitlist is full of inactive users.

• Commands don't count as activity, since Tastybot deletes those messages.

• Setting up an !afk message won't prevent you from being removed, you will still get warned, and still need to chat.
