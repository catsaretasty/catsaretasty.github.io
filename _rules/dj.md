1. **We only allow EDM (Electronic Dance Music). What is EDM? For info, [click here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electronic_music_genres)**
2. The song length limit is 10 minutes. Anything longer than this will be automatically skipped.
3. Playing mixes is not allowed. This means videos that play several songs sequentially. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFu2DfPDGeU) is an example. Mashups and remixes are allowed to be played.
4. Songs that are on the history can not be played. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Fkpjp5H.png) is how you can check the history.
5. If you are on the waitlist, you must chat at least every once 90 minutes, otherwise Tastybot will remove you from the waitlist. You will get 2 warnings prior to the removal.
6. Changing the title of a song or making it misleading is not allowed.
7. Keep the videos appropriate and safe for work (SFW). NSFW content includes: nudity, gore,
8. Do not play "troll" songs. They will be skipped and you may be kicked from the waitlist or the room.
9. You are encouraged to play your own songs, but we request that you do not play more than three of your own tracks in a single week. They can be 3 different tracks you can play in a week or 1 single track you play 3 times in a week. This rule also applies to channel promoters. We reserve the right to skip/kick those who we feel are taking advantage of our community in order to boost channel views.
10. Nightcore and Bassboost are not allowed, as those do not respect the artist's original point of view on their piece.

Using [Tastyplug’s](https://tastyplug.tastycat.org) **/opcheck** command will show you how often a song has been played the past day/week/month. If your song that is currently playing fits the criteria below, staff will be allowed to lockskip or skip it.

  • A song that has already been played **once** today should be avoided being played again.

  • A song that has been played **3 times** this week is not allowed to be played.

  • A song that has been played **10 times** this month is not allowed to be played.
