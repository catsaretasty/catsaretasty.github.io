4. Songs that are on the history can not be played. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Fkpjp5H.png) is how you can check the history.

9. You are encouraged to play your own songs, but we request that you do not play more than three of your own tracks in a single week. They can be 3 different tracks you can play in a week or 1 single track you play 3 times in a week. This rule also applies to channel promoters. We reserve the right to skip/kick those who we feel are taking advantage of our community in order to boost channel views.
